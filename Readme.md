* **Modular Design**: The codebase is organized into separate route handlers and utility functions, making it clean, maintainable, and scalable.
* **Dispute Management**: A built-in system allows users to raise payment disputes, which administrators can then verify and resolve, ensuring fairness and transparency.

### Important Notes

* **Security is paramount.** All admin actions must be performed using a **valid JWT token with admin privileges**. This token should be sent via a cookie or an authorization header.
* When resolving disputes, **always verify the user's order details** before alloting tokens or issuing refunds to prevent fraudulent activity.
* The system uses static file serving for the admin and user interfaces. The admin panel can be accessed at `/lunessa_payment_admin`, and the token purchasing page is at `/buy_agent_tokens`.
